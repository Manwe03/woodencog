# Wooden Cog

this mod is a compatibility mod for tfc and create.

Some of it's code came from [SeriousCreeper](https://www.youtube.com/@SeriousCreeper)
go check him out his videos are pretty cool. Also here's the original [mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-create)

Some of the code also came from the [Tinker's construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) mod (the small crucible) I updated it to my needs.

This mod is still in early stages and probably need a lot refactoring but still can be used.
I'll soon update my generators (yeah the nodejs mess in generators dir) to generate all missing crafts in this mod.

currently it includes :
- recipes for alloying with mixer
- custom basin to allow more fluids into it (4)
- some fixes for create mod that where needed for liquid only crafts
- some fixes on filters to allow tfc fluid usage (still need to check if it didn't broke anything else)

I don't know if this mod is compatible with other mod that use mixins for create but if you know one that don't work
open an issue on this repo i'll look into it

pull requests are welcomed.
